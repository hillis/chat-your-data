FHA Loan Requirements
Borrowers who are interested in buying a home with an FHA loan with the low down payment amount of 3.5% must have a minimum FICO score of 580 to qualify. A lower credit score than 580 doesn’t necessarily exclude you from FHA loan eligibility if you have a minimum down payment of 10%.
There are other requirements for FHA loans in addition to credit score and certain down payment amount. Here is the complete list of FHA loan requirements, which are set by the Federal Housing Administration:

1) Steady Employment History
Borrowers must be able to demonstrate a steady employment history or have been working for the same employer for the past two years.

2) Social Security Number
Borrowers must have a valid social security number, lawfully reside in the U.S. and be of legal age to sign a mortgage in their respective state at the time of application.

3) Down-Payment
Borrowers must put a minimum down payment of 3.5%, which can be gifted by a family member.

4) Owner-Occupied Residence
New FHA loans are only available for primary residence occupancy. You must live in the home as your primary residence after purchase. FHA loans are designed to encourage home-ownership. The owner-occupancy requirement prevents investors from buying the homes and renting them out.

5) Property Appraisal
Borrowers are required to have a property appraisal from a FHA-approved appraiser. The property must meet certain minimum standards at appraisal. If the home you want to purchase does not meet these standards and a seller will not agree to the required repairs, your only option is to pay for the required repairs at closing (to be held in escrow until the repairs are complete).

6) Front-End Ratio
Borrowers are generally required to have a front-end ratio (mortgage payment plus HOA fees, property taxes, mortgage insurance, homeowners insurance) of less than 31% of their gross income. Sometimes, you may be approved with as high a percentage as 40% but your lender will be required to provide justification as to why they believe the mortgage presents an acceptable risk. The lender must then include any compensating factors used for loan approval.

7) Back-End Ratio
Borrowers are required to have a back-end ratio (mortgage plus all your monthly debt, i.e., credit card payment, car payment, student loans, etc.) of less than 43% of their gross income. Sometimes, you may be approved with as high a percentage as 50% but your lender will be required to provide justification as to why they believe the mortgage presents an acceptable risk. The lender must include any compensating factors used for loan approval.

8) Minimum Credit Score
Borrowers are required to have a minimum credit score of 580 for maximum financing with a minimum down payment of 3.5%. Borrowers are required to have a minimum credit score of 500-579 for maximum loan-to-value (LTV) of 90% with a minimum down payment of 10%. FHA-qualified lenders determine on a case-by-case basis an applicants’ credit worthiness.

9) Bankruptcy
Borrowers must be two years out of bankruptcy and have re-established good credit. Some exceptions can be made if there were extenuating circumstances beyond your control that caused the bankruptcy and you have managed your money in a responsible manner.

10) Foreclosure
Borrowers must be three years out of foreclosure and have re-established good credit. Some exceptions can be made if there were extenuating circumstances and you’ve improved your credit. Not being able to sell your home because you had to move to a new area does not qualify as an exception to the three-year foreclosure guideline.

11) Loan Limits
The Federal Housing Administration is the one that sets maximum mortgage limits for FHA loans that vary by state and county. Loan limits range from $275,665 to $721,050 for a 1 living-unit property depending upon where you are buying a home.



FHA and conventional Loan limits vary based on the number of living-units on the property. FHA loans are only allowed on 1 to 4 living-unit properties. These 1 to 4 unit properties can be purchased with an FHA loan as long as the owner occupies one of the unit. Properties with over 4 units are considered commercial and do not quality for FHA or conventional loans.

Madison County Limits
Limits for FHA Loans in Madison County, Alabama range from $472,030 for 1 living-unit homes to $907,900 for 4 living-units. Conventional Loan Limits in Madison County are $726,200 for 1 living-unit homes to $1,396,800 for 4 living-units. The 2023 Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) limits in Madison County is $1,089,300. HECM limit does not depend on the size of the home.

Conventional Loans
Conventional loans (also called "conforming") are loans that conform to the requirements set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy home loans from lenders to provide liquidity. This allows lenders to continue lending to home buyers. Otherwise, banks might not have enough money on hand continue lending. Fannie and Freddie set strict standards for the types of loans they will buy.

To see if a home qualifies for an FHA loan, the property must be appraised by an approved FHA appraiser.

VA Loans are similar to FHA Loans in that it allows you to buy a home with very little money down. However VA Loans are only available to veterans of the Armed Forces. With VA loans the Department of Veterans Affairs guarantees the loan on the veteran's behalf. The maximum the VA will guarantee is set to the same amount as the single-family Fannie/Freddie Loan Limit. So the Madison County, AL 2023 VA Loan Limit is $726,200

The minimum loan amount in Madison County is $5,000 dollars and may go up to $907,900 depending on home size and loan type. In order to qualify for an FHA loan, you must be planning to live in the home. Although a loan can include some renovation costs, FHA loans cannot be used for real estate investments in Madison County.

If a pitcher is ambidextrous, the umpire shall require the pitcher to face a batter as\neither a left-handed or right-handed pitcher, but not both.\nRationale: The pitcher acquiring the sign from the catcher is one of the fundamental rules of baseball. It not\nonly signals the defensive team that action is about to be initiated, but it also establishes when an offensive\nbase runner(s) can take a lead-off from his/her base. That simple act has evolved over the last decade but\nwas not supported by an accompanying rule. This change validates the pitcher taking the sign from the\ndugout/bench via “call” signs, numbers, colors, or an arm wristband/placard that contains printed cards\nwhere the defensive set up/pitching repertoire is located. This aspect of the game has become more\nsophisticated to match the skill level and ability of today’s high school baseball player.\nBaseball Rules Changes - 2022\nBy NFHS on July 15, 2021\nbaseball","metadata":{"source":"/Users/mhillis/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Code/TrainDocs/chat-your-data/docs/sportsdata/nfhsbaseball.pdf"}}],["820",{"pageContent":"3/30/23, 7:30 PMhttps://www.nfhs.org/sports-resource-content/softball-rules-changes-2022/\nhttps://www.nfhs.org/sports-resource-content/softball-rules-changes-2022/1/2\n1-2-1: Clarifies bases may be designed to disengage from their anchor system.\nRationale: This change places rule language with other regulations covering the field and its equipment.\n1-3-3: Aligns ball tolerance specifications with other rule codes.\nRationale: Balls manufactured with the former specifications will be permitted through 2024, to allow for\nmanufacturers and schools to reduce current inventory.
